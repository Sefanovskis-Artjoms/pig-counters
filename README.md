# pig-counters

Initially a real small project for a meat factory, but after some events on their side, they decided that they don't want/need this project. And as I have already begun developing it, I decided to finish it just for fun(after that I also didn't bother much with some details)

The project's goal is to count occurrences of different foreign objects in different parts of a pig carcass with the added function of viewing reports of the past days.
